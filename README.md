**`hue-radar`** is a CLI tool for discovering all of the colors used in your project.

## Purpose

If not maintained well, large and long-running web app projects are likely to have colors littered throughout the codebase. This can make it difficult for your design or front-end team to audit, scale and maintain in the long run. This tool was created to help you identify and wrangle every color in your codebase.

It's sort of like `grep`ing for various colors, but better for the following reasons:

- Handles lots of edge-cases that a complex `grep` may miss.
- Supports all color types (eg: `hex`, `hsl`, `rgb(a)`).
- Presents findings in a normalized and reasonable way.
- Can produce a comprehensive color audit report for you.

## Installation

Install the tool in your project, or (optionally) you can do it globally.

```bash
yarn add hue-radar
npm i hue-radar

# Or globally
npm i -g hue-radar
```

## Usage

Call `hue-radar` with the options you desire, in the project.

```bash
hue-radar -p "*/**.{less,jsx}"
```

### Options

Option | Description | Default
--- | --- | ---
`--pattern, -p` | Glob pattern for files to match. [More info](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#usage). _Note that defaults are included before these patterns., so specify overrides if they do not suit you._ | `"**/*.css,!node_modules/**/*"`
`--debug, -d` | Print debug statements. | `false`
`--format, -f` | Output format for the color report, `json` or `html` | `json`
`--output, -o` | Path to the color report outputted file _(optional)_. | `hue-radar.report.{format}`
